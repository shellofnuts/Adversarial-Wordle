Adversarial Wordle

Adversarial Wordle is a game mimicing Absurdle by qntm.
The computer dynamically chooses a list of words that is
the furthest from your (The Player's) previous guesses.

It is the aim of the Player to narrow down the computer to
a single word in as few guesses as possible.

The minimum achieved is 4, where 3 guesses is likely impossible
to achieve.

The Player must guess a 5-letter word. \033[38;5;40mGreen\033[0m indicates that the
letter is in the correct position. \033[38;5;220mYellow\033[0m indicates that the
letter appears in the word but not in that position. \033[38;5;240mGrey\033[0m indicates
that the letter does not appear in the word at all.

These guesses will be reflected on a keyboard to for the Player.
